                            <ul>
                                    <li>Joseph M. Reeves</li>

                                  </ul>     
                    
                    <p> Though not credited as one of the creators, very influencial in the creation of the NFL helmet are the Riddell duo. Father and son,John T. Riddell and his son John T. Riddell Jr. </p>
                    <p>Joseph M. Reeves is the one most often credited with creating the helmet. He was an admiral in the United States Navy after being warned that one more blow to the head may cause "instant insanity," had the first helmet made for him in 1893.</p>
                    <p>James Naismith who is considered the "Father of Basketball," invented the helmet while playing for the YMCA International Training College football team in 1891.
                </p>
                <p>George Barclay a national championship winner at Lafayette College, had a shoemaker construct the first helmet to protect his damaged ears in 1894.
                </p>
                <p>The first NFL helmet was created out of moleskin, no you didn’t hear that wrong. This helmet was created by Reeves and was even used for a short time by US paratroopers during WWI.

                            <h3>Progression of the Helmet</h3>
                            <p>The first NFL helmet was created out of moleskin, no you didn’t hear that wrong. This helmet was created by Reeves and was even used for a short time by US paratroopers during WWI.
                                </p>
                                <p>Helmets did not always possess ear holes. In 1915 the helmet began to get its modern shape. Additional interior padding was added, along with flaps with ear holes allowing teammates to actually hear each other. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>In 1940, John T. Riddell and his son John T. Riddell Jr. did away with the leather helmet era when they began producing plastic helmets. The Riddell duo also invented the chin strap. The NFL didn’t accept the helmets right away. The helmets had a problem with shattering upon impact. Riddell responded by designing a helmet in the shape of a teardrop, which allowed the contact to slide to one side or the other instead of absorbing it head on. Once all these issues were sorted out, the NFL made the plastic helmet legal in 1949.</p>
           <p>The face mask made its debut around the mid-1930s when Vern McMillan, who owned a sporting goods store in Indiana, crafted a rubber-covered wire mask</p>
           <p>In 1955, Brown met with a Riddell consultant together they managed to fit a small radio transmitter into the helmet of his quarterback. This made it easier to coordinate plays with the loud stadium atmosphere. Though Browns' opponents discovered the radio transmitter, and the radio helmet was banned after just three games. The radio helmet was reintroduced in 1994 and is now in the helmet of every quarterback in the league.

     <p>Headgear evolution didn’t stop there in the '70s Riddell patented “Energy Absorbing and Sizing Means for Helmets." They included valves on top for air to be pumped into the interior padding. The player would put the helmet on, and then have it pumped up for a tailored skull fit. </p>

<h4>Some Fun Facts</h4>
<p>During a game in 1953, Browns coach Paul Brown conceived the single-bar face mask after his quarterback's mouth was torn open. Brown needed a way to keep his starting quarterback on the field in order to win.
    </p>
    <p>The first team to put a logo on their helmets was the Rams. Professional team logos started appearing on the helmets in 1948 when Fred Gehrke, a running back for the Los Angeles Rams, painted a horn design on all of the Rams' helmets. 
            Fun fact: the logos were initially intended to help the quarterback distinguish a downfield receiver from defenders.
