                    <h2>New Helmet</h2>
                    <p> This season, about 70 NFL players are wearing a new helmet that's a radical departure from previous iterations -- and is believed by many to be safer.
                        </p>  
                    <p>It isn’t easy to make a helmet that looks good, feels good and works good.
                            You don’t want a helmet that while protecting your head contracts you movements and affect your play negatively. You also don’t want one that is ugly and unpleasing to the eye and most importantly you want one that protects your head.
                            
                        </p>

                    <h2>The Helmet That is try to save the game.</h2>
                    <p> A Seattle-based startup VICIS worked with Artefact to design a football helmet that has sought to blend all three things.  An Artefact case study describes the ZERO1 football helmet as "safer, sexier and more functional." 
                        </p>
                        <p>VICIS CEO Dave Marver co-founded the company in 2013 with a number of colleagues from the University of Washington.</p>
                        <p>It is said to be a melding of medicine and engineering, traditional football helmets typically have a hard outer shell with foam padding on the inside, sort of like a really good cookie. The ZERO1 helmet goes the other way around it has an outer LODE shell that is deformable as well as an inner layer of columnar structures designed to absorb the force of impact.</p>
